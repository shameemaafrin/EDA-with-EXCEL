## Data Exploration with Excel
### Overview
This assignment focuses on exploring hurricane data using Microsoft Excel, demonstrating the power of simple data manipulation and visualization tools in extracting meaningful insights from climatic data.

### Key Deliverables and Tools
Data Source: Utilized HurrData.csv for hurricane data analysis.
Software Used: Microsoft Excel, which provides robust tools for data manipulation and visualization.

### Insights Derived

Hurricane Category Frequency:

Category 1 hurricanes occur most frequently, suggesting that lower category hurricanes are more common, although potentially less newsworthy than their higher-category counterparts.
Statistical Analysis of Hurricane Intensity:

Central Pressure and Max Winds:

<img width="481" alt="image" src="https://github.com/shameemaafrin/EDA-with-EXCEL/assets/77144007/7e78f751-fe53-4560-8171-552a74867380">

The mean, median, and range for central pressure were calculated as 965.08, 966, and 111 respectively.
For max winds, the values were 89.19 (mean), 90 (median), and 95 (range).
Correlation between Central Pressure and Max Winds:

An inverse relationship was observed, implying that as central pressure increases, the maximum wind speed tends to decrease.
Statewise Hurricane Occurrences:

Florida (FL) and Texas (TX) showed the highest frequencies of hurricane landfalls, making these states significant focuses for disaster preparedness.

### Data Cleaning Techniques Used
Employed Excel functions such as SUBSTITUTE and Text to Columns to clean the data.

Utilized UNIQUE and FLATTEN functions to summarize state counts effectively, revealing the distribution of hurricane impacts across different states.

### Concluding Thoughts
The assignment reinforced the capabilities of Excel as a tool for rapid data exploration and reinforced the importance of understanding data to draw actionable insights, particularly in the context of natural disaster preparedness.
